FFShare pipes image, video and audio files through ffmpeg before you share them.

Doing so reduces the file size and also has the added benefit of stripping all metadata that may be attached to those files.

To do this this just share your media files and choose <i>FFShare</i>. The app will open showing the compression progress and when it's done a new share dialog will reappear with the new compressed file.
