FFShare pipes videos and images through ffmpeg before you share them.

To do this this just share your videos or images and choose <i>FFShare</i>. The app will open showing the compression progress and when its done a new share dialog will reappear with the new compressed video or image.


<b>Source Code</b>

This app is open source and hosted on GitHub. A star would be greatly appreciated.
